## System Architecture

### Payment Flow

1. **User browses pricing** → `/pricing`
2. **Selects tier and period** → Clicks subscribe button
3. **API creates checkout session** → `/api/stripe/checkout`
4. **Redirects to Stripe** → Hosted checkout page
5. **Customer completes payment** → Stripe processes
6. **Webhook notifies app** → `/api/webhooks/stripe`
7. **Database updated** → Supabase subscriptions table
8. **Tier synced automatically** → Database trigger updates profiles
9. **User redirected** → Dashboard with updated tier

### Webhook Events Handled

- `customer.created` - Logs new Stripe customer creation
- `customer.subscription.created` - Creates subscription in database
- `customer.subscription.updated` - Updates subscription (upgrades, downgrades, renewals)
- `customer.subscription.deleted` - Marks subscription as canceled
- `invoice.payment_succeeded` - Logs successful payments
- `invoice.payment_failed` - Updates status to past_due

### Database Integration

The system uses Supabase with automatic tier synchronization:

- **Subscriptions table** stores all Stripe data
- **Profiles table** contains user membership tier
- **Database trigger** automatically syncs tier from subscriptions to profiles
- **RLS policies** ensure secure data access
- **Admin client** in webhooks bypasses RLS for system operations

## Testing Guide

### Local Development Setup

1. **Start Next.js dev server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Server runs on http://localhost:3000

2. **Start Stripe webhook listener** (in separate terminal):
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
   ```

3. **Copy webhook secret** from the output (starts with `whsec_`) and update `.env.local`:
   ```env
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_secret_here
   ```

### Test the Complete Payment Flow

#### Step 1: Sign Up/Sign In
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Sign In" or "Get Started Free"
3. Use magic link authentication

#### Step 2: View Pricing
1. Click "View Pricing" in navigation
2. Toggle between Monthly/Yearly billing
3. Observe 20% savings indicator for yearly plans

#### Step 3: Subscribe to Pro Tier (Monthly)
1. Click "Subscribe to Pro" under Pro tier
2. You'll be redirected to Stripe Checkout
3. Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
4. Expiry: Any future date (e.g., 12/34)
5. CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)
6. Complete the checkout

#### Step 4: Verify Subscription
1. You'll be redirected to dashboard
2. Check "Subscription & Billing" section
3. Verify tier shows "Pro Plan"
4. Verify status shows "active"
5. Check next billing date is displayed

#### Step 5: Test Billing Portal
1. Click "Manage Subscription" button
2. Verify redirect to Stripe billing portal
3. Test cancellation (will cancel at period end)
4. Test updating payment method

#### Step 6: Test Upgrade (Pro to Enterprise)
1. Navigate to pricing page
2. Click "Subscribe to Enterprise"
3. Complete checkout
4. Verify tier updates to Enterprise in dashboard

#### Step 7: Monitor Webhooks
Watch the Stripe CLI output for webhook events:
```
2025-10-25 19:36:06   --> customer.subscription.created [evt_...]
2025-10-25 19:36:06  <--  [200] POST http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
```

### Test Cards

| Card Number          | Expected Result        |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| 4242 4242 4242 4242 | Successful payment     |
| 4000 0000 0000 9995 | Payment declined       |
| 4000 0000 0000 0341 | Card attachment fails  |
| 4000 0025 0000 3155 | Requires authentication|

## Webhook Verification

### Check Webhook Status

1. **Stripe CLI Output**: Watch for events being forwarded
   ```
   --> customer.subscription.created [evt_...]
   <--  [200] POST http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
   ```

2. **Stripe Dashboard**: Visit https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/events
   - View all events
   - Check response status codes
   - Inspect payloads

3. **Application Logs**: Check for webhook processing messages
   ```
   Processing webhook event: customer.subscription.created
   Subscription sub_xxx upserted for user user_xxx
   ```

### Expected Webhook Flow for New Subscription

1. `customer.created` → Customer created in Stripe
2. `payment_method.attached` → Payment method saved
3. `customer.updated` → Customer metadata updated
4. `invoice.created` → Invoice generated
5. `invoice.finalized` → Invoice finalized
6. `customer.subscription.created` → Subscription created ✅
7. `payment_intent.created` → Payment initiated
8. `payment_intent.succeeded` → Payment successful
9. `invoice.payment_succeeded` → Invoice paid ✅
10. `charge.succeeded` → Charge completed

The ✅ events are critical for database updates.

## Database Verification

After a successful subscription, verify the database:

### Check Subscriptions Table

```sql
SELECT 
  user_id,
  stripe_customer_id,
  stripe_subscription_id,
  status,
  membership_tier,
  current_period_end
FROM subscriptions
WHERE user_id = 'your_user_id';
```

Expected result:
- `status`: 'active'
- `membership_tier`: 'pro' or 'enterprise'
- `stripe_subscription_id`: starts with 'sub_'
- `current_period_end`: Future date

### Check Profiles Table

```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  email,
  membership_tier
FROM profiles
WHERE id = 'your_user_id';
```

Expected result:
- `membership_tier`: Should match the subscription tier (automatic via trigger)

## Known Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Webhook returns 500 on subscription.created

**Cause**: User doesn't exist in database or Supabase admin client not configured

**Solution**: 
- Ensure user is authenticated before subscribing
- Verify SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is set correctly
- Check webhook logs for detailed error message

### Issue: Tier not updating after subscription

**Cause**: Database trigger not fired or RLS blocking update

**Solution**:
- Verify trigger is installed: `sync_membership_tier()`
- Check subscription status is 'active' or 'trialing'
- Ensure webhook is using admin client (bypasses RLS)

### Issue: Redirected to billing portal instead of checkout

**Cause**: User already has an active subscription

**Solution**: 
- This is expected behavior to prevent duplicate subscriptions
- Use billing portal to manage existing subscription
- Cancel existing subscription before creating new one
